Variables in javascript

var x;
Here x is the name of the variable. Like C++, a variable can be given any name, as
you like, with only one restriction, that it must be a valid identifier. We have used
the keywords int, float, char, etc. to declare different types of variables in
C++. But, in JavaScript, the same keyword, var is used to declare all type of variables

In JavaScript, merely declaring a variable does not define the variable. The variable
definition is complete only when it is assigned a value. JavaScript understands the
type of variable only when a value is assigned to that variable. Consider the following
declaration.
var x, y;
x = 25;
y = “INDIA”;
In the above example, the variable x is of number type and y is of string type. Even
though we say that x is of number type and y is of string type, note that we do not
specify them in code segments. The following example explains how JavaScript
defines variables.
