Creating functions in JavaScript

function print()
{
document.write(“Welcome to JavaScript.”);
}

Here, the keyword function is used to define a function. The word print that
follows, is the name of the function. The function name can be any valid identifier.
JavaScript uses the same rules for naming identifiers as in C++. Here the print()
function contains only one statement. We can include any number of statements
inside a function.
Defining a function does not execute the function automatically. It must be called
for its execution. This means that even if we define a function in a web page and do
not call the function, the function will not be executed at all. The function can be
called by using the function name as follows:
print();
Note the semicolon after the function name. Now let us make use of the above
print()function in an HTML page

Now let us see the syntax of a JavaScript function.
function function_name()
{
statements;
}

Here the line function function_name()is called the function header and
the code within the braces { and } is called function body. The main difference
from C++ is that, in JavaScript there is no return type, whereas in C++ the function
has a return type. In JavaScript also, we can return some value from a function as in
C++. Since this chapter is meant to give only a basic idea about the use of JavaScript,
we do not discuss them for the time being. Another difference is that, C++ does
not use the keyword function to define a function, but JavaScript does.
